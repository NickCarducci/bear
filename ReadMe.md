### Using [Wrangler 2](https://github.com/NickCarducci/mastercard-backbank) (5/2022) fails for service bindings[' environments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/environments/)

bearer authorization service worker to work in conjunction with (cloudflare) pages authorized ([firebase](https://github.com/NickCarducci/sausage/tree/maintenance/bear)) /api (resource hostname)path/referer firewall

[Service binding](https://blog.cloudflare.com/service-bindings-ga/) cloudflare protocol

request.clone() when a single path in your router, if any, is fetched twice

the module as opposed to service worker format for service workers have a function declaration fetch that does not count

as such a fetch as inside, where two readings would require a clone, again, per path (to even compile?)
